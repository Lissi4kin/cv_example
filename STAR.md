**Situation:** Let me share a story. It's a story from my current job. I'm not 100% sure that it is the best example, however let's try. I had commited to do a task rapidly, but I failed with estimations.
**Task:** My collegues and me discussed and released that there were an immense issue in our infrastructure, we suffered from that. Let me to be more specific, it was custom CFM solution for managing infrastructure. I commited to improve it. My idea was to use Ansible and as a result replace original custom CFM, I commited to do it rapidly, just couple of months. Unfortunately, world is cruel and it tooks much more time.
**Action:** We can talk for ages about underlying reasons for that. However, there were a couple of issues under the hood.
1. I was too optimistic, it created wrong time expectation from my collegues point of view.
2. There were lack of time management from my side.
3. I was burned out 
**Results:**
Finally I've done that migration, it took aprox 18 months. I'm thinking about creating transcription of my speech from DevOpsConf to share technical details with community. Moreover, I've learned some lessons from that situation & there are couple improvements in my life: 
1. I create SMART goals. 
2. I've been becoming more efficient person, you can read some articles at my website about improving my city or time managamnet in real life. I read & tried diffirent approaches, like SMART, GTD, kayzen.
3. I found my work\life balance. I added enough physical activity.
